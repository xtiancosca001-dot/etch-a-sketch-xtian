# Etch A Sketch
- This is my project that applies what I have learned about
  Javascript's DOM Manipulation.

# Overview
- The user can draw anything on a square grid by just
  hovering the mouse inside it with a fixed color
  of choice.
  - There is an option to change the grid size so that
    the User Interface can provide from 16x16 up to 100x100
    square grid.
- Additional Features:
  - The user can also:
    - Draw with random colors for every interaction.
    - Change gradient every 10 interactions with
      varying shades of color.
